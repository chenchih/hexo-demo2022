This is my network note which record different linux and debug command

# Debug Using tool

## Nmap port scan 

> **Scan port can use either:**
>> `nc -vz`: quick, lightweight probe (good for QA spot checks).
>> `nmap`: more detailed: can scan ranges, detect service versions, OS fingerprints, etc.

```
nmap -Pn -p 21 172.21.201.16
```
> **Scan port option:**
>> `-Pn`: don’t ping first (treat host as alive)
>> `-p 21`: scan only port 21


## Netcat: scan and send traffic
The `nc` command allow you to debug like send a small traffic or scan port just like `nmap`

### Scan if a port is open like nmap

> Syntax: `nc -vz ip-add port`
>>`-v`: verbose
>> `-z`: just scan for listening service (don’t send data)

- scan http
```
nc -vz 172.21.201.250 8080 
```
- scan ftp
```
nc -vz 172.21.201.250 21 #ftp
```

Output tells you if the port is open, closed, or filtered.

### Send traffic

If DUT **NOT support** `FTP` related command, when you want to debug field side issue, to make sure traffic is working or not. You can only use `http` , or `ftp` related potocol to verify it. Since use remote like ssh to debug, so the only method is use the `nc` command to check traffic work or not under ssh. 


If you want to verify traffic you have to first run nf command on local pc, and use tcpdump on field side ssh server to make sure you pass traffic really psss. I

Environment might look like this:

CPE(send traffic ex: `nf`) <------>(Lan) CPE (Wan)<------->Internet<-------->SSH field Router(tcpdump) 

#### send http
Netcat will try to connect to host 172.21.201.250 on TCP port 8080
```
nc 172.21.201.250 8080
```

If **something is listening** there (like a web server), the connection **opens** and anything you type will be sent to it.
If **nothing is listening**, you’ll get a **timeout** or connection refused, aslo mean netrwork unreachable

#### Send ftp

I can use this command below to make ftp connection

```
nc Ftp-IPaddress 21
```

{% asset_img ftp_connection.png %}


### Run server as listen

- Host 1 as listen server
```
nc -l -p 9090
```
>> Listens on TCP port 8080.
>> Any client that connects can send/receive text.

- Host 2 connect and send traffic
```
nc <Host 1 IP> 9090
```

### Quick file transer

```
# on Receiver
nc -l -p 9000 > file.txt
# On sender:
nc <IP> 9000 < file.txt
```

## tcpdump capture packet

In the top we use the `nc` command to send traffic, you also need to see the packet flow to make sure it really pass. 

> TCP 3 hand shake: `syn`->`syn/ack` -> `Ack`

If the traffic really make connection success then your packet should see the three flow

### Capture packet for 21 ftp 
```
tcpdump -i eth4_v0 -nn port 21
```
{% asset_img tcp_dump_traffic.png%}
 
### Save traffic as packet 
```
tcpdump -i eth1.1035 -s 0 -w /tmp/ap.pcap &

tcpdump -i br-lan.960 -s 0 -w /tmp/AP_vlan960.pcap &

tcpdump -i rax0 -s 0 -w /tmp/sta.pcap &

```


## Curl

Some DuT uses a light weight curl, which mean not support ftp or other feature. You can use `curl --version` to check. 

{% asset_img curl_ver.png %}


This mean even though you don;t have a ftp installed in your system, but you can use curl, however this version curl don't even support ftp. 

To use ftp right now is you need to use the `nf` command 

### Curl webpage
```
curl http://localhost/test1234/test.html 
```
### Fetch a file and store in a local file [-o option]
> **Syntax:** `curl -o [name of output] [url name]`
>> `o`: is rename another file


```
curl -o test.html http://127.0.0.1/tt.html #download and rename to test.html
curl -o filename.tar.gz http://filename-4.0.1.tar.gz # download and rename 
```


### Curl ftp connection

- username and password connection
```
curl -u user:pass ftp://192.168.1.163/
```
{% asset_img curl_ftp.png %}

- Download anonymous account
```
curl -u anonymous:anonymous -O http://192.168.3.181/iperfcommand.txt
curl -u anonymous:anonymous -O ftp://192.168.3.181/iperfcommand.txt
```

- upload
```
curl -u anonymous:anonymous -T [file name] [url]
curl -u anonymous:anonymous -T test.html  ftp://192.168.3.181/
multiple file upload:
curl -u anonymous:anonymous -T {file1,file2}  ftp://192.168.3.181/
```

## tftp

- linux or console
```
#upload to lcoal side from console
tftp -l wan0-cap.pcap -p 192.168.5.104
```

- window tftp might look different

> **Syntax:** `tftp -i [IP ADD] [PUT|GET][ FILE NAME]`
>> `-g`:     get file
>> `-r`:     remote
>> `-p`:     put file
>> `-l`:     loca

```
#download
tftp -i 192.168.1.55 PUT TLV43.cfg
#upload
tftp -i 192.168.1.55 GET TLV43.cfg
```

## scp upload download file

### scp 
```
#upload
scp filename username@192.188.4.21:/home/nrgnb/Downloads/
#download
scp username@host/var/gnb/log/collect/20220805.163658.log.tgz .
```

### using sshpass without type password

`sshpass` bypass the interactive password prompt for `scp` (and `ssh`).

> install: apt install sshpass

> **syntax:**: `sshpass -p 'server passw'  scp <filename or path> <sshhostname>:<destinationPath>`

- Example
```
sshpass -p 'nr@Gnb' scp l1app-0809 nrgnb@192.188.4.21:/home/nrgnb/Downloads/
sshpass -p scp nrgnb@192.188.4.21:/home/nrgnb/Desktop/chenchihFile/flow.pcapng .
```


- script
```
sshhostname="nrgnb@192.188.4.21"
echo -n "enter your local file name (source): "
read sourcePath
destinationPath="/home/nrgnb/Downloads/"
sshpass -p 'nr@Gnb' scp $sourcePath $sshhostname:$destinationPath
```
